# ola-uber-ride-prioject
This project simulates a simple ride-sharing system similar to Ola or Uber using Java OOP concepts like abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and exception handling.  Users can select a ride type (bike or car) and provide the travel distance. The system then calculates the fare accordingly and displays ride details
